        <h2>Params</h2>
                 <span class="param">pagefilter[](Required): one or more audio feature ranges that the returned tracks must match. Each filter should take the form name:min:mix e.g. filter[]=bpm:80:90&filter[]=percussiveness:0.5:0.6 will search for tracks with a tempo of between 80 and 90 bpm, and with an estimated percussiveness value of between 0.5 and 0.6.</span><br>
                 <p>
bpm                 - estimated tempo in beats per minute<br>
valence             - mood estimate on a scale from -1 (very sad) to 1 (very happy)<br>
aggression          - mood estimate on a scale from -1 (peaceful) to 1 (aggressive)<br>
avg_loudness        - average loudness in decibels relative to Full Scale i.e. the maximum volume that can be encoded<br>
peak_loudness       - peak loudness in decibels relative to Full Scale i.e. the maximum volume that can be encoded<br>
rhythmic_regularity - on a scale from from 0 (very varied rhythm) to 1 (very repetitive rhythm)<br>
percussiveness      - on a scale from (no percussive sounds) to 1 (many percussive sounds)<br>
noisiness           - the proportion of dirty/noisy sounds in the track, on a scale from 0 (very pure) to 1 (very dirty)<br>
gearshift           - indicates likely presence of gearshift modulation: 0 (no gearshift), 1 (gearshift by a semitone), 2 (by a tone), -1 (not sure)<br>
key                 - estimated key or mode: see <a href="key_legend.txt">here<a/> for an explanation of the possible values returned<br>
harmonic_creativity - on a scale from 0 (no harmonic variety) to 1 (many chord changes)<br>
smoothness          - rate of change of the melody and harmony parts on a scale from 0 (lots of fast changes) to 1 (very smooth)<br>
danceability        - on a scale from 0 (not for dancing) to 1 (very easy to dance to)<br>
energy              - estimated overall energy on a scale from 0 (very low energy) to 1 (very high energy)<br>
punch               - on a scale from 0 (not at all punchy) to 1 (very punchy)<br>
sound_creativity    - on a scale from 0 (very uniform timbre/instrumentation) to 1 (timbre changes a lot)<br>
tuning              - estimated pitch standard in Hertz, typically A=400Hz<br>
chordal_clarity     - estimate on a scale from 0 (very unclear harmonies) to 1 (very clear harmonies), key estimate should be accurate if this is high<br>
tempo_instability   - how much the tempo varies over the track on a scale from 0 (certainly a drum machine) to 1 (no recognisable tempo at all)<br>
rhythmic_intricacy  - on a continuous scale from 0 (ambient sounds) to 1 (highly complex), rock usually scores around 0.5<br>
speed               - subjective speed on a scale from 0 (very slow) to 1 (very fast)<br>
